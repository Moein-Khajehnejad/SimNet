# SimNet
This is the code which implements **SimNet**, a new method for network representation that is explained in our paper:  
>SimNet: Similarity-based Network Embeddings with Mean Commute Time.  
>Moein Khajehnejad and Wei Lu.  

The code can be applied to any arbitrary graph.  
#Code Usage
To run this source code use _Run_SimNet.m_ function. Entries to this function are the network's Adjacency Matrix and the appeald dimension for the final representation of the network. Simply add all the included functions and run the code.  
The output is a matrix representing the network.
#Note
a. In case the adjacency matrix representing the network has eigenvalues larger than one, simply divide all elements by     
`[size of matrix]Ã—[maximum element]`. It will guarantee sum of each row is lower than one, hence there will be no eigenvalue larger than one. Therefore the condition _alpha<1_ will be sufficient  for the similarity limit to converge.  
b. L2 norm imposition not needed.  
c. SimNet can be applied to un\weighted and undirected graphs. For a directed graph, add adjacency matrix and its transpose and use the resulted matrix as the first entry to Run_SimNet.  
d. _Matrix Alpha_ is used as a constant damping factor in calculating the similarity; Though if you wish to use a dynamic damping factor, simply replace this matrix with the equations illustrated in our paper.
